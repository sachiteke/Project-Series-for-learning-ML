# Project-Series-for-learning-ML

🙋🏽‍♀️ Hi, and welcome to this short project series!!
This series has 3 projects of different levels.

📌 Basic - Guess the word game
📌 Medium - 3D-plotting in Matplotlib
📌 Advanced - CNN using Tensorflow and Keras

Disclaimer❗❗ Guess the game was also a part of my python personal project. Still, I have uploaded the file here so you don't have to keep changing repositories.😊
